## HFY M2/W1 Homework Project: CODE ALONG

## This exercise was aimed to practise working with development strategy and using branches.
## Goals
* To get comfortable with branches
* To practise working according to Agile development method
* To learn about HTML semantic layout
* To exersice with CSS and HTML
* To learn how to write a dev strategy

## Tools
* Visual Studio Code 
* Gitkraken 
* GitHub

## Experience
* Youtube tutorial is super good structured, easy to understand and to follow
* The only challenging was with branching. As being a chaotic type of person, for me it was hard not to confuse the brances and not to edit a differnt section of another branch.
I am sure this question has been raised, but I have tried to find out if it is possible to undo a commit in GitKraken, if it was not yet published to GitHub.
